"""Independent plan validator: every hard constraint, as stable rule codes, for any plan (drafted or edited).

It re-derives each check from the context instead of trusting how the plan was built. The eight booklet rules come
from :func:`rules.check_rules` (whose ``rule`` names the DSP screens keep using) and are mapped to codes; the
structural checks (brand/district mixing, chilled on ambient, depot scope, split / duplicate / undecided orders)
are checked here.
